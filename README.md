MacKeyboard
===========


This [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) configuration file makes usual keyboard shortcuts work with an Apple keyboard on Windows with norwegian layout. Makes it easyer to develop on both OS X and Windows with the same keyboard layout. 

Installation
------------

- Install [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) 
- Run the `MacKeyboardNorwegian.ahk` file
- Put the `MacKeyboardNorwegian.ahk` file or a shortcut to the file in your Autostart folder to run it automatically on startup.

Feel free to send me pull request if you have changes or something is not working.
