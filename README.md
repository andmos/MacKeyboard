MacKeyboard
===========


This [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) configuration file makes usual keyboard shortcuts work with an Apple keyboard on Windows with norwegian layout. Makes it easier to develop on both OS X and Windows with the same keyboard layout. 

Programmers will note that all brackets has found the way to the correct keys, OS X style.

By populare demands the project is now split up in two versions: The standard MacKeyBoardNorwegian.ahk file has all the
function-keys intact. This version is meant for developers. The MacKeyBoardNorwegianWithMediaKeys.ahk has all the mediakeys
enabled. Feel free to choose.

Installation
------------

- Install [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) 
- Run the `MacKeyboardNorwegian.ahk` file (or `MacKeyBoardNorwegianWithMediaKeys.ahk` for mediakey-version)
- Put the `MacKeyboardNorwegian.ahk` file or a shortcut to the file in your Autostart folder to run it automatically on startup.

Feel free to send me pull request if you have changes or something is not working.
